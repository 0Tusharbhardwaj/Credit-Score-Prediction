Machine Learning Credit Score Prediction
Problem Statement
Credit scores are utilized by lenders to determine the creditworthiness of an individual. A good borrower is represented by a high credit score, whereas a low credit score represents a higher risk. This project aims to predict the Credit Score of an individual based on three important factors:

Age
Profits
Loan Amount
Using machine learning methods, we develop a model that can examine past data and predict a person's credit score.

Dataset Information
The data set (credit_data.csv) has the following columns:

CustomerID - Unique identifier for every customer (Not used during training)
Age - The customer's age (Numeric)
Revenue - The customer's yearly revenue (Numeric)
LoanAmount - Amount of loan applied or sanctioned (Numeric)
CreditScore - actual credit score (Target variable, Numeric)
Technologies Used
Python (Data Processing and Machine Learning)
Pandas and NumPy (Data Manipulation) Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Model and Feature Scaling) Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data Visualization)
